1. Declare and initialize struct VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo (https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo.html)
	The number of command buffers are coventionally equal to number of swapchain images.
2. Declare command buffer array globally and allocate it to swapchain image count.
3. In a loop , which is equal to swapchainImageCount, allocate each command buffer in above array by using vkAllocateCommandBuffers(). //https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkAllocateCommandBuffers.html
   Remember at time of allocation all commandbuffers will be empty.
   Later we will record graphic/compute commands into them.
4. In unitialize(), free each command buffer by using vkFreeCommandBuffers()(https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkFreeCommandBuffers.html) in a loop of size swapchainImage count.
5. Free actual command buffer array.

Note:
Secondary command buffer can be called from with primary command buffer
Primary command buffer can be submitted.
